"Can you cancel my service with nrg?I don't have a log in. "
"Help me understand...I switched to purchasing electricity from you in August of 2018.  I was sold on you by a salesman at Menards.  The first 3 months the rate was consistent ($.06800/kWh), and I was pleased.  Then came November when the rate increased to $.08100/kWh, and finally December when the rate went up to $.09700/kWh.  On the other hand, the rate from the ComEd suppliers has remained somewhat consistent.  I am feeling a bit swindled here...is this how it works?  A good rate for a few months and then several increases?  I am writing to find out what I can expect from here so I can decide on my best supply option.  Thanks for your time,Tammy Dreiske"
