I would appreciate if the managing director or a chief engineer contacts me. This is regarding information on flue gas coming out of your coal power generating plant. We have developed the most cost-effective emission capture technology by which nearly 100% of the CO2 and the associated toxic components of the flue gas can be captured by a single equipment which can fit a new coal plant and retrofit to an old coal plant at a cost of $8 to $16 per ton of CO2 captured. Our small company is applying for federal grants to prototype the technology for a small coal power plant (10-25 MW) and to generate a complete design (with dimensions of components) of the equipment based on our technology for an industrial size coal power generating station (250 MW ? 1.0 GW). I need some information for the design of the large equipment for emission capture. Also, I want to know if your company can collaborate with ours to secure the federal grant.

You may have seen the recent news articles about the extraordinary electricity usage with regards to Bitcoin mining, and the consequent effect on the global climate. This has caused Bitcoin's price to drop by a substantial amount. Bitcoin Climate Accord is attempting to solve this issue by connecting Bitcoin miners with the REC market, to offset Bitcoin's emissions.

Bitcoin Climate Accord is looking for specific pricing information for RECs, and in particular for any generating unit owners who may be willing to transact direct in Bitcoin, as this would be much more convenient for the Bitcoin miners, and has the potential to be very profitable for generating unit owners as well. 

If this sounds like an interesting area of exploration, please call or email.

I undertook this project in my college Final Year. I have been successful in building a prototype which generates 120 Watts of peak energy.

Link: https://youtu.be/piybQv9laGY

Watch this video. It is the proof of my work. I have ideas to expand this project such that it can generate energy from every vehicle that passes. From 2 wheelers to 18 wheelers and even more. Give me a chance to take this project further and I will deploy it at a huge level to produce sustainable energy. I need support of people or companies like yours in order to execute this. I await your kind and valuable response. I am willing to develop this project further, I just need your support. Waiting for you kind response.

Thank You

 From the video it can be seen that the Electric power multiplier with an area of 240 cm2 in comparison with a solar cell of a solar panel of the same area surpasses the latter by 23 times in power and this figure can increase, while the Multiplier works around the clock and year-round.
 At the same time, the Multiplier does not require repair, maintenance and related infrastructure such as gas stations.
