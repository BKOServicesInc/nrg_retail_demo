I would appreciate if the managing director or a chief engineer contacts me. This is regarding information on flue gas coming out of your coal power generating plant. We have developed the most cost-effective emission capture technology by which nearly 100% of the CO2 and the associated toxic components of the flue gas can be captured by a single equipment which can fit a new coal plant and retrofit to an old coal plant at a cost of $8 to $16 per ton of CO2 captured. Our small company is applying for federal grants to prototype the technology for a small coal power plant (10-25 MW) and to generate a complete design (with dimensions of components) of the equipment based on our technology for an industrial size coal power generating station (250 MW ? 1.0 GW). I need some information for the design of the large equipment for emission capture. Also, I want to know if your company can collaborate with ours to secure the federal grant.

We have designed our car such that our car would be an one time investment as people would be rarely forced to spend on fuel .It would also combat problems like lack of electric recharge centres , pollution , global warming , climate change , overheating in electric cars , the problem because of which people do not prefer to buy solar energy driven cars.

I've been a very good customer paying our lease bill on time. I even had referred you guys to my family of which my Daughter daSilva, 72 Stage Coach Pass, Stormville NY went with NRG.

You may have seen the recent news articles about the extraordinary electricity usage with regards to Bitcoin mining, and the consequent effect on the global climate. This has caused Bitcoin's price to drop by a substantial amount. Bitcoin Climate Accord is attempting to solve this issue by connecting Bitcoin miners with the REC market, to offset Bitcoin's emissions.

Bitcoin Climate Accord is looking for specific pricing information for RECs, and in particular for any generating unit owners who may be willing to transact direct in Bitcoin, as this would be much more convenient for the Bitcoin miners, and has the potential to be very profitable for generating unit owners as well. 

If this sounds like an interesting area of exploration, please call or email.

Occasionally, we have irate NRG Energy customers calling us about various issues (i.e., their account sign-up at Walmart, their bill, or that your company is drilling holes in their roof). Do you have a good phone number to which we can direct their call? I see there are two numbers on your ""Contact Us"" page, one for Houston and one for Princeton.

Generating energy from speed breakers. I undertook this project in my college Final Year. I have been successful in building a prototype which generates 120 Watts of peak energy.

Watch this video. It is the proof of my work. I have ideas to expand this project such that it can generate energy from every vehicle that passes. From 2 wheelers to 18 wheelers and even more. Give me a chance to take this project further and I will deploy it at a huge level to produce sustainable energy. I need support of people or companies like yours in order to execute this. I await your kind and valuable response. I am willing to develop this project further, I just need your support. Waiting for you kind response.

NRG has partnered with Rice in the past, and our lab is working on some great research right now that we wanted to share with y'all in hopes of receiving some assistance finding participants.

The studio, led by Professor Linda Samuels, is speculating on the Hyperloop proposal from LA-LV and STL-KC. The studio will be visiting Los Angeles and Las Vegas, looking at transient oriented infrastructure projects, as well as other large scale infrastructure projects, such as Ivanpah Solar Electric. I was wondering if it would be possible to tour the facility or to have a general information session about this project and solar technology/energy generation. The studio will be driving from LA to Las Vegas on Friday, February 1st, and a tour of the facility would be extremely rewarding and helpful for the design students.

We are requesting to photograph and film the Solar facility to illustrate the role that sustainable energy will play in transitioning towards a carbon neutral economy in the near future. 

Please let us know if this request is possible or if you require any more information from us. We will be visiting California between the 6th June and 12th of July. We would be photographing with a digital medium format camera on a tripod and a video camera on a gimbal, we would not need to use a drone or require interviews. We expect the photography filming to take less than 4 hours total. We would be happy to provide all footage and images for your use.

My name is Chloe Costello and I live in Illinois, near the Will County Generating Station. 

This is perhaps a strange request, but a young adult close to me has moderate Autism and he has always been deeply fascinated by Will County Generating Station at 529 Romeo Rd, Romeoville, IL 60446. He is very fixated on the power station, and has exhausted all of the online information he can find about it.

He grew up watching the smokestacks from his window, and it is his basically his dream to see the generating station up-close. He wants to learn everything there is to know about the station and how it functions. 

I am trying to fulfill this dream of his by reaching out and seeing if it is possible to take him on a tour of the station.

Is this a possibility? It would be a dream come true for him. I am not sure how to contact the station directly, hence my reason for contacting you.

Thank you so much for your time.

Dear Partner,							         08/30/2019

Requesting Sponsorship of the first African Festival in Staten Island, New York

As September is African Heritage Month in New York City, and because 2019 marks the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans landing in America, I am writing on behalf of the organizing committee to introduce and invite you to our inaugural Park Hill Annual African Cultural Heritage Festival scheduled to take place on September 28, 2019 with the theme ?Africa on the Hill?. To accomplish this challenge of bringing the unique African cultures together, with food, clothing, artifacts, traditional dance, cultural drums and drummers, incorporated with the dynamism of various artists now producing these traditional lyrics in the music industry around the global, we must be able to raise no less than or a minimum of $35.000.00.  Please support.

Using cleaner coal and oil would be a good benefit to our environment and would be a good idea towards working to. 
Overall, I really appreciate you guys lately taking a step towards a better environment by building solar and wind farms around your facilities which will take up less electricity. However, I feel you should try and use less watts to produce your energy so that it doesn?t release as much natural gases into the air as it does.

I am reaching out to see if NRG has an interest in joining the NJ Sustainable Business Registry.  The Department of Environmental Protections thinks that NRG is a natural fit for the Registry, as you are already committed to sustainability in your daily operations.  
Here is a link to Registry Website: http://registry.njsbdc.com/.

The Registry is open to any business in the state, from retail stores to manufacturing  companies ? and there is no cost to join. The Registry allows businesses to create a profile, documenting their sustainable practices.  For a business to join, they need to submit information about: 

?             5 sustainable practices they have implemented
?             A cost savings realized due to the implementation of one practice
?             A measurable benefit due to the implementation of one practice (like a reduction in waste, water use, energy, gas, etc?)

My name is Chase Ripper and I work in the public outreach department of The Mesothelioma Center (Asbestos.com).

Asbestos exposure has been linked to the development of serious respiratory diseases, including lung cancer, asbestosis, and even mesothelioma. Our organization provides free informational books, packets and a Patient Advocacy program that works 1-on-1 with individuals to help them find local doctors, treatment centers and support groups.

I was wondering if you'd be interested in including our organization as a resource to educate the public about the dangers of asbestos and help anyone suffering from mesothelioma find free care and support.
