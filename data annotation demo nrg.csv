The first 3 months the rate was consistent ($.06800/kWh), and I was pleased.  Then came November when the rate increased to $.08100/kWh, and finally December when the rate went up to $.09700/kWh.  On the other hand, the rate from the ComEd suppliers has remained somewhat consistent.  I am feeling a bit swindled here...is this how it works?  A good rate for a few months and then several increases?  I am writing to find out what I can expect from here so I can decide on my best supply option.

Dear Sir:

I write to advise you of land that I own in the very northern part of the State of Maine that might be of interest to you to lease for development for 20-30 years or whatever.  
 I feel optimistic in saying this to you as I have within the last few weeks received two unsolicited inquiries concerning the leasing of my land for 20-30 years from solar power companies.

One company has gone so far as to provide me a rather detailed development map for 40 acres of my cleared land with a greater than 5 MWp (DC) capacity. My farm, although I am not a farmer, is located near a substation and power line that connects into a transmission line to the Boston area. Ergo, I do not believe this outreach will be a waste of your time unless it is just too small an undertaking for your consideration. You don't know if you don't ask.

If you feel that it would be mutually beneficial for us to discuss my land further please advise.

Shalom, Peace, Salaam,

With your resources it could be built fine tuned an in production within 12 months.

Converting them to zero emissions will help more than any miracle cure.

It takes 50-100 years to grow a Forest.
It takes less than a day to burn it to the ground.
But when it burns it contributes to global warming.

My name is MacKenzie Elmer, a program coordinator for Scripps Institution of Oceanography's Climate Science and Policy masters program in San Diego, California. Our cohort of 12 graduate students is very interested in renewable and alternative forms of energy, a critical piece of climate policy.
 
I am contacting you to inquire whether Bright Source Energy would be willing to take our students on a tour of Ivanpah in Ivanpah Dry Lake, California the week of Sept. 10? We understand the plant is viewable via public access roads but we would actually like an inside look at with staff member to answer informational questions.
 
Concentrated solar is a valuable clean energy source for thousands of Californians during peak demand. Our students would love to learn how it works and will use this knowledge as they pursue future careers in science and policymaking.

I appreciate any help you can give me, and please let me know if there is anymore information I can provide.
